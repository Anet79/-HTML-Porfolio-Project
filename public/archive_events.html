<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>
    Development an application using MVVM design patterns and serves as a military archive whose purpose is to store and retrieve military information by location such as photos, videos, articles, and more about past military and security events. The system supports data storage and retrieval using a search engine. Following the development of this system I learned how to program in a team under time and knowledge constraints.</p>
